Tic Tac Toe rules:

X always goes first.

Players cannot play on a played position

Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

    One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
    All nine squares are filled.

If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

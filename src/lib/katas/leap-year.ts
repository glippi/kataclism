Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.
The following rules determine if an integer is a leap year:

  * It is NOT a leap year if it is NOT divisible by 4.
  * It is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
  * It is a leap year if it is divisible by 400.
  * It is NOT a leap year if it is divisible by 100 but NOT by 400.

For example:

  * 1997 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4)
  * 1996 is a leap year (divisible by 4)
  * 1600 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
  * 1800 is NOT a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400)
